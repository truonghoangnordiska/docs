Credit card onboarding for sole traders is the process through which your business customers apply for and receive their credit cards. This involves comprehensive checks and assessments to ensure responsible lending while maintaining a smooth user experience, including additional business verification steps.

## What is Sole Trader Card Onboarding?

Sole trader card onboarding encompasses the entire journey from application to card activation:

1. **Application Submission** - Customer provides personal, financial, and company information
2. **Verification & Assessment** - Automated checks, credit evaluation, and business verification
3. **Agreement Signing** - Digital signing of terms and conditions
4. **Card Issuance** - Physical or virtual card creation
5. **Activation** - Card ready for use

## Key Processes

### Application Processing

Initial validation and comprehensive checks including:

- **Application Validation**: Verifying completeness and format of submitted data
- **Internal Checks**: Invoice payment history, block lists, and existing customer records
- **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: PEP screening, sanctions lists
- **Know Your Business (KYB)**: Adverse media screening
- **Credit Assessment**: Schufa integration, Creditsafe business credit checks, income verification, risk scoring
- **Authorization Verification**: Ensuring authorized signatory status

<Warning>
Credit assessments are binding for 30 days. Sole traders who are rejected due to credit scoring can reapply after 3 months. Business verification failures may require additional documentation.
</Warning>

### Identity Verification

Once credit and business assessment is approved, customers complete identity verification:

- **Document Verification**: Validation of government-issued IDs
- **Liveness Check**: Ensuring the person is physically present
- **Data Matching**: Verifying information matches official records
- **Signatory Authorization**: Confirming the individual is authorized to sign on behalf of the business

<Info>
Identity verification for sole traders may take slightly longer due to additional business authorization checks, but typically completes within minutes using automated systems.

### Document Signing

Once identity verification is completed, sole traders must digitally sign:

- **Credit Agreement**: Terms and conditions for the credit facility
- **Privacy Policy**: Data processing agreements

The signing process uses **Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES)** which provide:
- **Legal Equivalence**: Same legal status as handwritten signatures under eIDAS regulation
- **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographically ensures the signer cannot deny having signed
- **Multi-lingual**: Available in German and English
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets EU standards for financial services
