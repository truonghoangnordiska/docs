Nordiska's Credit Card as a Service platform enables partners to offer credit cards to their customers under their own brand while leveraging our robust financial infrastructure.

## What is Credit Card as a Service?

Credit Card as a Service is a comprehensive white-label solution that allows businesses to issue credit cards without building their own banking infrastructure. Through our partnership with Enfuce and integration with major payment networks, we handle the complex regulatory, technical, and operational aspects of card issuance.

## Credit Card Features

Our credit card offering includes:
- **Instant credit decisions** powered by automated credit scoring
- **Flexible credit limits** from €500 to €10,000
- **Buy Now, Pay Later** integration for installment purchases
