Credit card onboarding is the process through which your customers apply for and receive their credit cards. This involves comprehensive checks and assessments to ensure responsible lending while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## What is Card Onboarding?

Card onboarding encompasses the entire journey from application to card activation:

1. **Application Submission** - Customer provides personal and financial information
2. **Verification & Assessment** - Automated checks and credit evaluation
3. **Agreement Signing** - Digital signing of terms and conditions
4. **Card Issuance** - Physical or virtual card creation
5. **Activation** - Card ready for use

## Key Processes

### Application Processing

Initial validation and comprehensive checks including:

- **Application Validation**: Verifying completeness and format of submitted data

- **Know your customer (KYC)**: PEP screening, sanctions lists
- **Credit Assessment**: Schufa integration, income verification, risk scoring

<Warning>
  Credit assessments are binding for 30 days. Customers who are rejected due to credit scoring can reapply after 3 months.
</Warning>

### Identity Verification

Once credit assessment is approved, customers complete identity verification:

- **Document Verification**: Validation of government-issued IDs
- **Liveness Check**: Ensuring the person is physically present
- **Data Matching**: Verifying information matches official records

<Info>
  Identity verification typically completes within minutes using automated systems, ensuring a smooth experience for approved customers.

### Document Signing

Once identity verification is completed, customers must digitally sign:

- **Credit Agreement**: Terms and conditions for the credit facility
- **Privacy Policy**: Data processing agreements

The signing process uses **Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES)** which provide:

- **Legal Equivalence**: Same legal status as handwritten signatures under eIDAS regulation
- **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographically ensures the signer cannot deny having signed
- **Multi-lingual**: Available in German and English
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets EU standards for financial services
