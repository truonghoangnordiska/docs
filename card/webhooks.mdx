Webhooks provide real-time notifications about changes in the card onboarding process. Your system will receive HTTP POST requests whenever significant events occur during the credit card application lifecycle.

## How Webhooks Work

We guarantee delivery and ordered processing:

1. **Event Generation**: Onboarding events are generated when status changes occur
2. **Conditional Enqueueing**: Events are only enqueued if webhook delivery is configured for the tenant
3. **Sequential Processing**: Events are processed in order per onboarding ID using sequence numbers
4. **Reliable Delivery**: Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff

## Configuration

<Warning>
Webhook endpoints must be configured by your integration contact person before going live. Configuration includes the webhook URL, signing secret, and optional authentication header.
</Warning>

### Requirements

Your webhook endpoint must:
- Accept HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads
- Respond with HTTP 2XX status for successful processing
- Process requests within 30 seconds (configurable)
- Be accessible over HTTPS

Optional:
- Verify webhook signatures for security

### Webhook Configuration

Webhooks are configured per tenant in the system with:
- **Webhook URL**: Your endpoint to receive notifications
- **Signing Secret**: Used for HMAC signature verification
- **Authentication Header**: Optional bearer token or API key

## Retry Policy

The service implements a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff:

- **Maximum Retries**: 10 attempts (configurable)
- **Initial Delay**: 100ms
- **Backoff Strategy**: Exponential with jitter

After all retries are exhausted, the webhook event is marked as permanently failed.

## Webhook Events

The system sends webhooks for these onboarding lifecycle events:

### SIGNING_SESSION_CREATED

Triggered when a credit card application is approved and ready for document signing.

```json
{
  "eventType": "SIGNING_SESSION_CREATED",
  "onboardingId": "7a0d9433-4f64-4f93-919c-5ab7d81eea55",
  "signingUrl": "https://sign.dev.nordiska.com/?sessionId=1fa6ef79-16e7-4665-ae78-c885e65e372b"
}
```

**Required Actions**:
1. Redirect customer to complete document signing

### SIGNING_SESSION_COMPLETED

Triggered when a customer successfully completes document signing.

```json
{
  "eventType": "SIGNING_SESSION_COMPLETED",
  "onboardingId": "7a0d9433-4f64-4f93-919c-5ab7d81eea55"
}
```

**Required Actions**:
1. Initiate card creation process

### ONBOARDING_COMPLETED

Triggered when the entire onboarding process finishes successfully.

```json
{
  "eventType": "ONBOARDING_COMPLETED",
  "onboardingId": "7a0d9433-4f64-4f93-919c-5ab7d81eea55",
  "engagementId": "8b9fd836-9d01-4c91-b0e0-17dfc26944e9"
}
```

**Required Actions**:
1. Store engagement ID for future reference

### ONBOARDING_REJECTED

Triggered when a credit card application is declined during assessment.

```json
{
  "eventType": "ONBOARDING_REJECTED",
  "onboardingId": "7a0d9433-4f64-4f93-919c-5ab7d81eea55",
  "rejectReason": "CREDIT_SCORING_DENIAL"
}
```

**Rejection Reasons**:

| Reason | Description | Customer Action |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `KYC_DENIAL` | Failed identity verification or sanctions screening | Contact support, provide additional documentation |
| `CREDIT_SCORING_DENIAL` | Insufficient creditworthiness based on bureau data | Can reapply after 3 months |

### ONBOARDING_FAILED

Triggered when a technical error occurs during the onboarding process.

```json
{
  "eventType": "ONBOARDING_FAILED",
  "onboardingId": "7a0d9433-4f64-4f93-919c-5ab7d81eea55",
  "failureCode": "ADDRESS_MISMATCH"
}
```

**Failure Codes**:

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | System error requiring investigation | Contact support, retry after resolution |
| `ADDRESS_MISMATCH` | Address doesn't match official records | Update application with correct address |
| `NAME_MISMATCH` | Name doesn't match official records | Verify spelling, provide correct legal name |
| `ID_VERIFICATION_FAILED` | Identity verification failed | Provide additional documentation |
| `TIMEOUT` | Process timeout occurred | Retry application |

## Webhook Security

All webhooks include security headers to verify authenticity and prevent replay attacks.

### Headers

```http
X-Card-Onboarding-Signature: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
X-Card-Onboarding-Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:35:00Z
Authorization: Bearer your-auth-token
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Signature Verification

The service generates HMAC-SHA256 signatures using the format `timestamp:payload`:

## Event Ordering and Idempotency

### Sequential Processing

The service guarantees that webhook events are delivered in the correct order per onboarding ID using:

- **Sequence Numbers**: Each event gets an incrementing sequence number
- **Ordered Delivery**: Events are processed in sequence number order
- **Blocking**: If an earlier event fails, later events are blocked until retry succeeds
