Credit card onboarding is the process through which your customers apply for and receive their credit cards. This involves comprehensive checks and assessments to ensure responsible lending while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## What is Card Onboarding?

Card onboarding encompasses the entire journey from application to card activation:

1. **Application Submission** - Customer provides personal and financial information
2. **Verification & Assessment** - Automated checks and credit evaluation
3. **Agreement Signing** - Digital signing of terms and conditions
4. **Card Issuance** - Physical or virtual card creation
5. **Activation** - Card ready for use

### Credit Assessment

For credit card applications, we perform comprehensive creditworthiness evaluation:

- **Credit Bureau Checks**: Integration with Schufa (Germany)

- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Calculation of existing financial obligations
- **Payment History**: Review of previous payment behavior with Nordiska
- **Risk Scoring**: Proprietary algorithms for credit limit determination

<Warning>
Credit assessments are binding for 30 days. Customers who are rejected due to credit scoring can reapply after 3 months.
</Warning>

### Identity Verification (KYC)

Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures ensure we're onboarding legitimate customers:

- **Document Verification**: Validation of government-issued IDs
- **PEP Screening**: Checks against Politically Exposed Persons lists
- **Sanctions Screening**: Verification against international sanctions lists
- **Address Verification**: Confirmation of residential address
- **Duplicate Detection**: Preventing multiple applications from same individual

<Info>
KYC checks typically complete within seconds using automated systems, ensuring a frictionless experience for legitimate customers.
