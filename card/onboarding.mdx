# Card Onboarding Process

Credit card onboarding is the process through which your customers apply for and receive their credit cards. This involves comprehensive checks and assessments to ensure responsible lending while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## What is Card Onboarding?

Card onboarding encompasses the entire journey from application to card activation:

1. **Application Submission** - Customer provides personal and financial information
2. **Verification & Assessment** - Automated checks and credit evaluation
3. **Agreement Signing** - Digital signing of terms and conditions
4. **Card Issuance** - Physical or virtual card creation
5. **Activation** - Card ready for use

## Key Processes

### Identity Verification (KYC)

Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures ensure we're onboarding legitimate customers:

- **Document Verification**: Validation of government-issued IDs
- **PEP Screening**: Checks against Politically Exposed Persons lists
- **Sanctions Screening**: Verification against international sanctions lists
- **Address Verification**: Confirmation of residential address
- **Duplicate Detection**: Preventing multiple applications from same individual

<Info>
KYC checks typically complete within seconds using automated systems, ensuring a frictionless experience for legitimate customers.

### Credit Assessment

For credit card applications, we perform comprehensive creditworthiness evaluation:

- **Credit Bureau Checks**: Integration with Schufa (Germany) and UC (Sweden)
- **Income Verification**: Assessment of stated monthly income
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Calculation of existing financial obligations
- **Payment History**: Review of previous payment behavior with Nordiska
- **Risk Scoring**: Proprietary algorithms for credit limit determination

<Warning>
Credit assessments are binding for 30 days. Customers who are rejected due to credit scoring can reapply after 3 months.
</Warning>

### Document Signing

Once approved, customers must digitally sign:

- **Credit Agreement**: Terms and conditions for the credit facility
- **SECCI**: Standard European Consumer Credit Information

The signing process is:
- **Legally Binding**: Using qualified electronic signatures
