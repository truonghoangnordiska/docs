This guide walks through the technical integration flow for implementing card onboarding in your application.

## High-Level Process

The card onboarding integration follows a webhook-driven asynchronous pattern, allowing your system to react to state changes in real-time:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant Partner
    participant CardService
    participant SigningService
    participant Enfuce

    Customer->>Partner: 1. Initiate card application
    Partner->>CardService: 2. POST /api/engagements/card/onboarding
    Note over CardService: Status: PROCESSING
    CardService->>CardService: 3. KYC, Credit checks
    
    alt Application Approved
        CardService->>Partner: 4. Webhook: SIGNING_SESSION_CREATED
        Note over CardService: Status: AWAITING_SIGNING
        Partner->>Customer: 5. Redirect to signing URL
        Customer->>SigningService: 6. Complete signing
        CardService->>Partner: 7. Webhook: SIGNING_SESSION_COMPLETED
        Note over CardService: Status: AWAITING_CARD_CREATION
        Partner->>Enfuce: 8. Create customer/account/card
        Enfuce->>CardService: 9. Notify card created
        CardService->>Partner: 10. Webhook: ONBOARDING_COMPLETED
        Note over CardService: Status: COMPLETED
    else Application Rejected
        CardService->>Partner: Webhook: ONBOARDING_REJECTED
        Note over CardService: Status: REJECTED
    else Application Failed
        CardService->>Partner: Webhook: ONBOARDING_FAILED
        Note over CardService: Status: FAILED
    end
```

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Initiate Application

Your customer submits their card application through your interface. Collect all required information and submit to Nordiska's Card Service.

### Step 2: Submit to Card Service

Make a POST request to `/api/engagements/card/onboarding` with the applicant's information. The service immediately returns an onboarding ID and begins processing.

### Step 3: Handle Processing

The Card Service performs automated checks:
- KYC verification against PEP and sanctions lists
- Credit scoring through bureau integrations
- Internal risk assessment

This typically completes within 3-10 seconds.

### Step 4: React to Webhooks

Based on the processing outcome, you'll receive one of several webhooks:

- **SIGNING_SESSION_CREATED**: Application approved, redirect customer to sign
- **ONBOARDING_REJECTED**: Application declined, show appropriate message
- **ONBOARDING_FAILED**: Technical issue occurred, handle error gracefully

### Step 5: Document Signing

For approved applications, redirect the customer to the provided signing URL. The signing service handles:
- Document presentation
- Identity verification
- Qualified electronic signature capture

### Step 6: Card Creation

After successful signing, create the card in Enfuce:
1. Create customer record
2. Create account linked to credit facility
3. Order physical/virtual card

### Step 7: Complete Onboarding

Once Enfuce confirms card creation, the onboarding completes and the customer can start using their card.

## State Management

### State Transitions

The onboarding process moves through defined states, each representing a specific phase:

<Steps>
  <Step title="PROCESSING">
    Initial validation and automated checks in progress.
    
    **Duration**: 3-10 seconds
    
    **Next States**:
    - AWAITING_SIGNING (approved)
    - REJECTED (declined)
    - FAILED (error)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AWAITING_SIGNING">
    Application approved, waiting for customer signature.
    
    **Duration**: Customer-dependent (max 30 days)
    
    **Actions Required**:
    - Redirect customer to signing URL
    - Monitor for completion webhook
    
    **Next States**:
    - AWAITING_CARD_CREATION (signed)
    - FAILED (signing expired/cancelled)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AWAITING_CARD_CREATION">
    Documents signed, ready for card issuance.
    
    **Duration**: Partner-dependent
    
    **Actions Required**:
    - Create Enfuce customer
    - Create Enfuce account
    - Order card
    
    **Next States**:
    - COMPLETED (card created)
    - FAILED (creation error)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="COMPLETED">
    Onboarding finished successfully.
    
    **Result**:
    - Credit engagement active
    - Card ordered/issued
    - Customer can transact
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="REJECTED">
    Application declined during assessment.
    
    **Reasons**:
    - KYC_DENIAL
    - CREDIT_SCORING_DENIAL
    
    **Customer Action**:
    - KYC issues: Contact support
    - Credit issues: Reapply after 3 months
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="FAILED">
    Technical or validation error occurred.
    
    **Error Codes**:
    - INTERNAL_ERROR
    - ADDRESS_MISMATCH
    - NAME_MISMATCH
    - ID_VERIFICATION_FAILED
    - TIMEOUT
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Implementation

The integration relies on webhooks to notify your system of status changes in real-time. When key events occur (approval, signing completion, etc.), Nordiska sends HTTP POST requests to your configured webhook endpoint.

**Key webhook events**:
- **SIGNING_SESSION_CREATED**: Application approved, customer needs to sign
- **SIGNING_SESSION_COMPLETED**: Customer finished signing documents  
- **ONBOARDING_COMPLETED**: Entire process completed successfully
- **ONBOARDING_REJECTED**: Application declined during assessment
- **ONBOARDING_FAILED**: Technical error occurred
